\begin{abstract}
    This paper describes the implementation of a \acrfull{dlt}-system which solves the \textbf{3 aspects of the \gls{trilemma}} better than any current system. The system distinguishes itself technically in \textit{4 key ways}: The consensus protocol, the data storage method, the swapping algorithm, and its use of time-based staking. The system uses the \textit{Hashgraph algorithm} as its \acrfull{abft} consensus protocol. The protocol's asymptotic communication complexity is quadratic (theoretically optimal), making the effective throughput of the system significantly greater than blockchain alternatives. Moreover, the protocol has deterministic finality, enabling the system to order activity and transfer the byzantine proof to the storage layer. Finality also greatly enhances the \textbf{scalability} of the system, when combined with the second distinguishing feature: The \textit{\acrshort{dart}}. The \acrfull{dart} saves data in a hash invariant database, allowing the system to be stateless. Lastly, the system uses \textit{swapping} to achieve \textbf{decentralisation}, while maintaining \textbf{security} by using \textit{time-based staking}. Tagion isn't just another \acrshort{dlt}; it's a fundamentally new infrastructure that is scalable, secure, decentralised, fair, and sustainable.
